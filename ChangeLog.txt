	* Changed utilities.pl so that it automatically
	recognizes which Prolog version is used
	and loads utilities_{swi,sicstus}.pl --
	Now there is no need for installation instructions anymore...

	* Minor change in recognize_active.pl:
	Simplified the code for topdown filtering 

	* Better commenting in recognize_active.pl: 
	The axioms and inference rules are now also shown in 
	a style similar to Ljunglöf (2004) and Burden & Ljunglöf (2005)

	* Fixed Sicstus problem with module prefixes in 
	the predicate remove_clauses/1-2 in the file utilities.pl.
	Also fixed some missing library module imports for Sicstus.
